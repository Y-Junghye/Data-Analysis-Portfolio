## **1. Background**
*   Analysis is required to induce additional purchases from customers based on the purchase history data of 'Daitda' company in 2021.

## **2. Data**
*   Data containing customers' personal and purchase history information collected.
     *   Includes customer number, age, order number, order date, order quantity, etc.


## **3. Analysis** 

#####   *  Monthly Classification and Analysis
     *   May had the highest customer purchases and revenue.
     *   January had the lowest payment amount.
  
#####   *  Day-of-Week Classification and Analysis
     *   Customers made significant payments on Wednesdays.
     *   Weekends (Saturday and Sunday) collectively accounted for about half the purchase amount compared to Wednesdays.

#####   * Age Group Classification and Analysis
     *   In terms of overall purchase trends by age group, customers in their 40s made the most purchases, followed by those in their 50s, 30s, and 60s and above.
     *   Regarding purchase methods by age group, teenagers, 20s, 30s, and 40s preferred mobile purchases, while those in their 50s and above preferred TV purchases.

#####   *  Yearly Classification and Analysis
     *   Customers between 2015 and 2017 showed low purchasing behavior, indicating the need for strategies to increase sales.
     *   Active purchasing was observed among customers who joined in 2019 and 2020.
       - Analysis of customers who joined in 2020 revealed a preference for groceries.
       - In terms of age analysis as of 2020, customers in their 40s made the highest payment amount.
       
#####   * Clustering Classification and Analysis
     *   Cluster 0 showed a preference for groceries.
     *   Cluster 1 showed a preference for women's clothing.
     *   Cluster 2 showed a preference for furniture/interior items.

 ## **4. Conclusion**
     *   To devise strategies to induce additional purchases from customers, the following conclusions were drawn:
       - Discount coupons should be distributed for use on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
       - Since customers tend to make the most purchases on Wednesdays and about half the purchases on weekends, offering a 10% discount coupon on Wednesdays and a 50% discount coupon on weekends could increase revenue.
     *  Focus should be on customers who joined between 2015 and 2017 instead of those actively engaged from 2018 to 2021.
       - Since most purchases by customers who joined between 2015 and 2017 were low, discounted sales focusing on groceries, women's clothing, and furniture/interior items identified through clustering analysis are needed.
     *  Promotions should target the most frequent purchasers, the 40s age group, and the largest age group, the 50s.
       - As customers in their 40s prefer mobile purchases and those in their 50s prefer TV purchases, alternative methods should be used to induce additional purchases.

## **5. Expected Impact**
    *  In addition to basic data analysis, understanding the purchasing characteristics of customers by similar clustering (cluster) analysis is possible.
    *  A 10% increase in sales revenue is expected for the following year and customer retention is expected to be maintained.
