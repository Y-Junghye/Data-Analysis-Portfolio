## Project 4. Identifying Pass:Fail in the semiconductor process

- Problem definition
   - Identify the main causes of deviations that can occur in the semiconductor process through sensor data

- Performance role
   - Data preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data visualization, data type and missing value checking
   - Identify important variables through logistic model and random forest model analysis for all data and specific variables
 
- Expected effects and Lessons and Learned
  + Expected effects
   - Improved the quality of the semiconductor manufacturing process by more than 20% compared to before.
   - As semiconductor manufacturing process efficiency increases and quality improves, the number of new customers who heard rumors increased by 30% compared to before.
   - Monthly revenue increased by 500 million won due to increase in new customers.

  + Lesson and Learned
   - Learned that judgment of defect (pass/fail) is a key issue in order to increase efficiency in the semiconductor manufacturing process.
   - Since the correct data preprocessing process leads to the determination of defects and abnormal data and has a significant impact on sales, there is a need to learn the data
     preprocessing process more deeply and apply it in practice.

## Project 5. Sales Analysis by Category

- Problem definition
   - From the company's sales perspective, it is necessary to analyze sales by category (main category, subcategory) and explore future growth plans.

- Performance role
   - Data collection from online commerce companies as of March 2014
   - Data preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data visualization, data type and missing value confirmation (purchase trend analysis by year, month, day of the week, and
     customer purchase location)
   - Regression analysis for each category and analysis of the top 3 categories
 
- Expected effects and Lessons and Learned
  + Expected effects
   - Classification of sales by category and identification of sales growth plans
   - Customer product consumption characteristics can be analyzed in various categories such as city, year, month, day of the week, customer purchase location, etc.
      
  + Lesson and Learned
   - By analyzing one customer data by dividing it into various groups (city, year, month, day of the week, etc.), it is possible to derive insights that cannot be obtained through
     general data analysis.
