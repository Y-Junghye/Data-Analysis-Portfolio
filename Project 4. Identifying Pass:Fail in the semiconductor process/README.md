## **1. Background**
     *  dentifying the main causes of yield deviation in semiconductor processes using sensor data
  
## **2.  Data**
     *  Collection of semiconductor process data (measurement time, sensor data, defect status)

## **3. Analysis** 

#####   *  Analysis Goals:
     *  Development of a model to predict pass/fail yield in semiconductor process

#####   *  Priorities:
     *  Identifying important variables through logistic regression models and random forest models
     *  Introducing management systems based on the most relevant signals found by the models 

#####   *  Data Analysis:
     *  Analysis of data using two models after completing data preprocessing
     
#####   *  Analysis Tools
     *  Python

 ## **4. Results**
     *  Based on this, logistic regression and random forest analyses were conducted, revealing that variables 59, 510, and 103 were the most important in the models.
     *  Using the key signals identified as 59, 510, and 103, efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing processes.

## **5. Expected Effects**
     *  Improvement of semiconductor manufacturing quality by more than 20% compared to existing standards
     *  Increase in efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing processes, accompanied by improved quality, leading to a 30% increase in referrals from satisfied new customers
     *  With the increase in new customers, monthly revenue is expected to increase by 500 million won.
