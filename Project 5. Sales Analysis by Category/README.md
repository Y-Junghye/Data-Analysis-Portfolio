## **1. Background**
*   Analyzing sales by category (main category, sub-category) from the perspective of revenue for an e-commerce company as of March 2014 and devising future growth strategies.

## **2. Data**
*  Utilizing data including customer demographics, transaction history, and category data from 2011 to March 2014.

## **3. Analysis** 

#####   * First, we looked at the status of orders being placed or canceled by year, month, and day of the week.
     *   When comparing by year, many orders occurred in 2012 and 2013, and many order cancellations occurred in 2012. However, when comparing by year, the number of orders and cancellations was similar, making comparison difficult.
     *   By month, the order volume was highest in February, January, and October, and the most cancellations occurred in February, October, and April. In January, there are not many order cancellations.
     *   By day of the week, Friday is the most common, but similar occurrences occur on other days of the week, so it seems difficult to make a difference. However, the number of cancellations occurred in the order of Thursday and Friday, and the least number of cancellations occurred on Sunday.

#####   * Customers also tend to make a lot of purchases in e-shops.

#####   * When separated by gender by major category, the consumption categories of men and women were the same, but except for bags, men had higher transaction amount and order quantity in other items.

#####   * When divided by day of the week by major category, bags are Thursday for both men and women, books are Tuesday for women, Sunday are for men, clothing are Tuesday for women and Monday for men, electronics are Tuesday for women, Men's purchases were higher on Saturdays, footwear purchases were higher on women's Wednesdays and men's purchases were higher on Sundays, and home and kitchen purchases were higher on women's Mondays and men's Fridays.

     *   female
       - bags : Thursday
       - home and kitchen : Monday
       - clothing, electronics, books : Tuesday
       - footwear: Wednesday
     *   male
       - bags : Thursday
       - books : Sunday
       - clothing : Monday
       - electronics : Saturday
       - footwear : Sunday
       - home and kitchen : Friday

#####   * Detailed category analysis showed that transaction amount and quantity were similar.

#####   * No gender distinction
     *   When divided into major categories by day of the week, a lot of books were ordered overall.
     *   In terms of categories, most purchases were made for home and kitchen on Fridays, books on Sundays, bags on Thursdays, clothing on Tuesdays, footwear on Wednesdays, and electronics on Saturdays.
     *   However, there are no special events on Mondays, so it is assumed that there are many orders for books.

#####   * When analyzing the order volume of major categories in each city, the following items were ordered in large quantities in each city.
     *   Cities 1 and 3: home and kitchen
     *   Cities 2 and 8: electronics
     *   Cities 4 and 7: books
     *   Cities 5 and 10: bags
     *   City 6: clothing
     *   City 9: footwear

 ## **4. Conclusion**

#####   *  When comparing main and sub-categories, it was difficult to differentiate based on revenue, so growth strategies were devised based on main categories.

#####   * Consideration of city-specific consumption characteristics is necessary.
     *   In order to grow sales based on city, a strategy must be established to improve purchases for each major category: books on Sunday and Monday, clothing on Tuesday, footwear on Wednesday, bags on Thursday, home and kitchen on Friday, and electronics on Saturday.
     *   Based on the days of the week above, considering the categories with the most orders in each of the 10 cities, different strategies are needed, such as selling items in the category at a lower price or distributing discount coupons for each city.
     
#####   * The reason why the number of product order cancellations was the highest on Thursday is because both men and women tend to purchase bags on Thursdays, and in the case of bags, there is less burden of order cancellation, so there are many cancellations.
     *   In particular, it has been shown that women purchase larger bags than men, so it is necessary to encourage women to purchase more bags by holding a large sales event in January, when people spend more and cancellations are less.

## **5. Expected effect**
    *  Through data analysis focusing on major categories and subcategories, purchasing characteristics by category can be identified.
    *  It is possible to establish measures to increase sales by understanding customersâ€™ overall purchasing patterns.
